# snake-game
The knowledge that I've gained about OOP, as well as what I learned about how to use the turtle module to build the famous snake game. 

Now, this is propably one of the most famous mobile games that wver was. A snake game that has, a moving snake, which you control using your keyboard, and you can go and get food, and then it grows in length as it eats more food. And you have to make sure that you don't end up getting tangled or hitting the wall. And the goal is to eat as much food as you can while staying alive.
